        <p class="sentence">
          Many Chinese are still using "VPN" as their main method to cope with
          the GFW, which isn't reliable at all and brings all kinds of
          frustration. VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It's used for
          secure Internet communication, and it's not designed for crossing the
          GFW. The data request pattern with VPN is very distinguishable, and
          nowadays GFW can easily detect and block your VPN services.
